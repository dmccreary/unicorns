## p5.js 2.x Upgrade: MicroSim Fixes Needed (2026-09-05)

A static scan of this repo's `docs/sims/` MicroSims found **3 sim(s)** using p5.js v1-only APIs that will break if upgraded to p5.js 2.x (the microsim-generator skill's templates now default to p5@2.3.2). Fix these before bumping this repo's MicroSims past p5@1.x.

- [ ] **ai-unicorn-generator** (`docs/sims/ai-unicorn-generator/`)
    - `ai-unicorn-generator.js` uses `curveVertex(...)`, renamed to `splineVertex()` in v2 with changed anchor-point rules — rename to `splineVertex()`; drop the old duplicated first/last anchor points and rely on `endShape(CLOSE)` for a smooth closed loop.
- [ ] **hype-cycle-journey** (`docs/sims/hype-cycle-journey/`)
    - `hype-cycle-journey.js` uses `curveVertex(...)`, renamed to `splineVertex()` in v2 with changed anchor-point rules — rename to `splineVertex()`; drop the old duplicated first/last anchor points and rely on `endShape(CLOSE)` for a smooth closed loop.
- [ ] **llm-how-it-works** (`docs/sims/llm-how-it-works/`)
    - `llm-how-it-works.js` uses `quadraticVertex(...)`, folded into `bezierVertex()` in v2 — replace with `bezierOrder(2)` followed by single-control-point `bezierVertex()` calls.
