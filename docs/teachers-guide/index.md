# Teacher's Guide

Welcome to the teacher's guide for *Unicorns and Other Mythical Beasts: An Essential Guide to Creatures That Definitely Exist and the Technologies That Will Improve Them*. This guide explains every feature of the textbook, how to use it in your classroom, and how to customize it for your students. No prior technical knowledge is assumed — every technical term is defined before it is used.

## About This Interactive Intelligent Textbook

### What is an Intelligent Textbook?

An **intelligent textbook** is a digital textbook that goes beyond static text and images. It includes interactive simulations, self-grading quizzes, a searchable glossary, and a structured map of how concepts relate to each other. The goal is to give students a richer, more engaging learning experience than a traditional printed textbook.

### The Five Levels of Intelligent Textbooks

Not all digital textbooks are created equal. We categorize intelligent textbooks into five levels based on how interactive and adaptive they are:

<iframe src="https://dmccreary.github.io/intelligent-textbooks/sims/book-levels/main.html" height="500px" scrolling="no"
  style="overflow: hidden;"></iframe>

| Level | Name | Description | Example Features |
|-------|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Level 1** | Static Digital | A PDF or basic web version of a print textbook | Text and images only, no interactivity |
| **Level 2** | Interactive | Adds interactive elements like simulations, quizzes, and searchable glossaries | MicroSims, self-check quizzes, concept search |
| **Level 3** | Adaptive | Adjusts content based on student performance | Personalized learning paths, difficulty adjustment |
| **Level 4** | AI-Assisted | Includes an AI tutor that can answer student questions | Chatbot integration, automated feedback |
| **Level 5** | Fully Adaptive AI | Continuously learns from student interactions and optimizes the experience | Real-time content generation, predictive analytics |

**This textbook is a Level 2 Intelligent Textbook.** It includes interactive MicroSims, structured chapter content with embedded simulations, a learning graph, and mascot-guided navigation. It does not yet include adaptive learning paths or AI chatbot integration.

### What Makes This Textbook Different

- **Interactive MicroSims** let students manipulate models directly in their browser — no software installation required
- **Critical thinking emphasis** — every chapter helps students distinguish between real technology capabilities and the hype, marketing, and magical thinking that surround them
- **Satirical framing** — mythical beasts serve as allegories for modern technology phenomena, making abstract concepts memorable and accessible
- **Learning graph** — a visual map showing how all 141 concepts connect and build on each other
- **Sparkle the Unicorn** — a friendly mascot character (called a "pedagogical agent") who guides students through each chapter with tips, encouragement, and key insights
- **Completely free and open source** — licensed under Creative Commons for non-commercial use

## Using the Chapters

### Chapter Structure

The textbook contains **19 chapters** organized in a deliberate sequence. Each chapter builds on concepts from previous chapters, so students should work through them in order:

| Chapters | Topic Area |
|----------|-----------|
| 1-3 | Foundations of Unicorn Studies (history, taxonomy, the unicorn-industrial complex) |
| 4-7 | AI and the Myth of Progress (how AI works, hype cycles, disruption, job displacement) |
| 8-11 | Mythical Beasts in Modern Society (centaur workforce, phoenix reinvention, siren automation, unicorn spotting) |
| 12-14 | The Future of Mythical Intelligence (breeding better unicorns, the Grand Council, meta-fiction) |
| 15-19 | Technology Fantasies (quantum computing, blockchain, ethical Bitcoin, the metaverse, bestiary of vaporware) |

### What Each Chapter Contains

Every chapter follows a consistent structure:

1. **YAML front matter** — Metadata at the top of each chapter file (title, description, reading level, version). Students don't see this; it's used by search engines and the website builder.
2. **Summary** — A brief overview of what the chapter covers and what students will learn.
3. **Concepts covered** — A numbered list of the specific concepts addressed in the chapter, drawn from the learning graph.
4. **Prerequisites** — Links to prior chapters that should be completed first.
5. **Welcome from Sparkle** — A mascot admonition that introduces the chapter topic in Sparkle's measured, deadpan voice.
6. **Main content** — The core instructional material, written at a 9th grade and up reading level. Includes tables, real-world examples, and embedded MicroSims.
7. **Mascot admonitions** — Throughout the chapter, Sparkle appears 5-6 times to highlight key insights (thinking), offer practical tips (tip), provide encouragement on harder concepts (encourage), and warn about common mistakes (warning).
8. **Key takeaways** — A numbered summary of the most important concepts, preceded by a celebration from Sparkle.
9. **Self-assessment question** — An expandable section that tests whether students understood the chapter's core concepts.

### Suggested Classroom Use

- **Before class**: Assign the chapter as reading homework. The MicroSims keep students engaged during independent reading.
- **During class**: Use the MicroSims on a projector for whole-class demonstrations. Ask students to predict what will happen when you change a slider, then test their predictions.
- **After class**: Assign the self-assessment questions and critical thinking challenges. Use the quiz (when available) for a quick formative assessment.
- **Pacing**: Each chapter is designed for approximately 2-3 class periods (90-135 minutes of instruction). Some chapters with more MicroSims may take longer.

## Using the MicroSims

### What is a MicroSim?

A **MicroSim** (short for "micro-simulation") is a small, interactive simulation that runs directly in a web browser. Students don't need to install any software — MicroSims work on any device with a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

Each MicroSim lets students manipulate one or more variables (using sliders, buttons, or drag-and-drop) and immediately see how the model responds. This "learn by doing" approach helps students build intuition for abstract concepts.

### How MicroSims Are Embedded

MicroSims appear within chapter text as rectangular interactive areas. They are embedded using **iframes** — a web technology that displays one web page inside another. You don't need to understand how iframes work; just know that the MicroSims load automatically when students view the chapter page.

### Types of MicroSims

The textbook includes over 32 MicroSims built with different visualization technologies:

| Technology | What It's Good For | Example MicroSims |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **p5.js** | Interactive animations with sliders and buttons | Beast Classification Framework, AI Unicorn Generator, Real or Fake Quiz |
| **Chart.js** | Bar charts, line charts, dual-axis charts | Unicorn Valuation Growth, LinkedIn Skill Inflation, Metaverse Hype Cycles |
| **vis-timeline** | Interactive timelines with zoom and hover | AGI Timeline Claims, Five Years Away, Moving the Goalposts |
| **vis-network** | Network diagrams showing connections | Beast Allegory Network, Medieval Unicorn Beliefs |
| **Leaflet** | Interactive maps with markers | Ancient Unicorn Civilizations Map |

### Tips for Using MicroSims in Class

1. **Project them on a screen** — MicroSims are designed to be visible on a projector. Have students call out predictions before you move a slider.
2. **Let students explore independently** — After a demonstration, give students 5-10 minutes to experiment on their own devices.
3. **Use the "Reset" button** — Every MicroSim has a reset button. Encourage students to reset and try different scenarios.
4. **Connect to the text** — Each MicroSim is placed near the concept it illustrates. After exploring the sim, have students re-read the surrounding text.
5. **Offline access** — MicroSims require an internet connection unless you have built the site locally (see "Customizing Your Own Textbook" below).

!!! mascot-tip "Sparkle's Tip: Embed MicroSims Anywhere"

    <img src="../img/mascot/tip.png" class="mascot-admonition-img" alt="Sparkle shares a tip">
    You can add any MicroSim to **any web page** — a Google Site, a
    WordPress blog, an LMS like Canvas or Schoology, or even a plain
    HTML file. Just paste a single line of HTML:

    ```html
    <iframe src="https://dmccreary.github.io/unicorns/sims/YOUR-MICROSIM-NAME/main.html"
        width="100%" height="450px"
        scrolling="no">
    </iframe>
    ```

    Replace `YOUR-MICROSIM-NAME` with the name of any MicroSim from
    the [MicroSims list](../sims/index.md). That's it — one line of
    code and your students have an interactive simulation on any page
    you control.

### MicroSim Specifications

Within each chapter, you'll find a collapsible **details** section below each MicroSim labeled with its name. Click to expand and see the full specification including:

- **Bloom's Taxonomy level** — What cognitive level the MicroSim targets (Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create)
- **Learning objective** — What students should be able to do after using the MicroSim
- **Interactive controls** — What sliders, buttons, and inputs are available
- **Default parameters** — The starting values when the MicroSim loads

These specifications are useful for lesson planning and for understanding the pedagogical intent behind each simulation.

## Customizing Your Own Textbook

One of the most powerful features of this textbook is that you can create your own customized version. This section explains how, step by step.

### Key Technical Terms

Before we begin, here are some terms you'll need to understand:

- **Repository (repo)** — A folder on GitHub that contains all the files for a project. Think of it as the project's home directory.
- **Git** — A version control tool that tracks changes to files. It lets you see what changed, when, and by whom.
- **Clone** — Making a complete copy of a repository on your own computer.
- **Fork** — Making a complete copy of a repository on your own GitHub account (stays on GitHub, not your computer).
- **MkDocs** — The software that converts the textbook's markdown files into a website. You don't need to learn MkDocs deeply — just enough to make basic changes.
- **Markdown** — A simple text formatting language. If you can write an email, you can write Markdown. `**bold**` makes **bold**, `# Heading` makes a heading, and `-` makes a bullet point.
- **mkdocs.yml** — The main configuration file for the textbook website. It controls the site title, navigation structure, colors, and which features are enabled.

### Step 1: Create a GitHub Account

If you don't already have one, go to [github.com](https://github.com) and create a free account.

### Step 2: Fork or Clone the Repository

**Option A: Fork (easier, stays on GitHub)**

1. Go to [dmccreary/unicorns](https://github.com/dmccreary/unicorns)
2. Click the **"Fork"** button in the upper-right corner
3. This creates a copy in your own GitHub account that you can edit

**Option B: Clone (more control, works on your computer)**

1. Install Git on your computer ([git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/))
2. Open a terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on Mac)
3. Run this command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dmccreary/unicorns.git
```

This downloads the entire textbook to your computer.

### Step 3: Make Changes

All content files are in the `docs/` folder. They are written in **Markdown** (`.md` files) — plain text files with simple formatting. You can edit them with any text editor.

#### Changing the Title and Description

Open `mkdocs.yml` and edit these lines:

```yaml
site_name: "Your Custom Textbook Title"
site_description: "Your description here"
site_author: "Your Name"
```

#### Changing the Colors

In `mkdocs.yml`, find the `palette` section:

```yaml
theme:
  palette:
    - scheme: default
      primary: purple    # Change to: blue, red, teal, green, etc.
      accent: pink       # Change the accent color
```

MkDocs Material supports these primary colors: red, pink, purple, deep purple, indigo, blue, light blue, cyan, teal, green, light green, lime, yellow, amber, orange, deep orange, brown, grey, blue grey.

#### Changing the Logo

Replace the file `docs/img/logo.png` with your own logo image (PNG format, approximately 128x128 pixels).

### Step 4: Preview Your Changes Locally

1. Install Python (version 3.8 or newer) from [python.org](https://python.org)
2. Install MkDocs and the Material theme:

```bash
pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material
```

3. Navigate to the project folder and start the preview server:

```bash
cd unicorns
mkdocs serve
```

4. Open your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/unicorns/` to see your customized version

The preview server watches for file changes. When you edit and save a Markdown file, the page automatically refreshes in your browser.

### Step 5: Publish Your Version

To publish your customized textbook as a free website using GitHub Pages:

```bash
mkdocs gh-deploy
```

This command builds the website and publishes it to `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/unicorns/`. The process takes about 1-2 minutes.

## The Learning Graph

### What is a Learning Graph?

A **learning graph** is a visual map showing how concepts in the textbook depend on each other. It is structured as a **DAG** (Directed Acyclic Graph) — a diagram where arrows show which concepts must be understood before others.

For example, understanding "Unicorn-Industrial Complex" requires first understanding "Venture Capital" and "Unicorn Startup Metaphor." The learning graph makes these dependency chains visible.

### How Teachers Can Use the Learning Graph

- **Prerequisite checking** — Before teaching a concept, verify that students have covered its prerequisites
- **Remediation** — If a student struggles with a concept, trace back to its prerequisites to find the gap
- **Curriculum mapping** — Compare the learning graph to your existing syllabus to identify coverage gaps
- **Enrichment** — Advanced students can explore concepts ahead of the current chapter by following the graph forward

The interactive Learning Graph Viewer is available in the "Learning Graph" section of the left navigation.

## Sparkle the Unicorn: Your Pedagogical Agent

### What is a Pedagogical Agent?

A **pedagogical agent** is a character that appears throughout a textbook to guide students. Research shows that pedagogical agents improve student engagement and perception of learning — a phenomenon called the **persona effect**.

### How Sparkle Appears

Sparkle the Unicorn appears as colored callout boxes (called **admonitions**) throughout each chapter. There are seven types:

| Type | Color | Purpose | Frequency |
|------|-------|---------|-----------|
| Welcome | Purple | Introduces the chapter | Every chapter opening |
| Thinking | Magenta | Highlights key insights | 2-3 per chapter |
| Tip | Green | Shares practical advice | As needed |
| Warning | Red | Alerts to common mistakes | As needed |
| Encourage | Blue | Supports on harder concepts | Where students may struggle |
| Celebration | Purple | Celebrates progress | Every chapter ending |
| Neutral | Gray | General notes | As needed |

Sparkle appears no more than 5-6 times per chapter to avoid overuse. Mascot admonitions are never placed back-to-back.

### Tips for Teachers

- **Read Sparkle's tips aloud** — They're written in a deadpan academic tone that works well when delivered straight-faced
- **Use as discussion prompts** — Sparkle's "thinking" admonitions highlight the most important (and sharpest) observations in each chapter
- **Encourage struggling students** — Point students to Sparkle's "encourage" admonitions when they're grappling with uncomfortable truths about technology
- **The satire is the point** — Sparkle's deadpan delivery mirrors the book's tone. If students ask "is this serious?" the answer is always "entirely"
